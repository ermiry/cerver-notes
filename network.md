# Networking

### Networking Today
Among all of the essentials for human existence, the need to interact with others ranks just below our need to sustain life. Communication is almost as important to us as our reliance on air, water, food, and shelter.

**What is the Internet?**
The internet is a worldwide collection of interconnected networks.

**How computers can interact with each other?**
Computers can communicate with their peers in the same local network (LAN). However the information that be shared may be limited, so the goal is to enable fast communications with as many as possible to better spread the knowledge.

**What is the purpose of computers connections?**
To share resources and data to enable a better production with a higher yield.

**What is an IP?**
Internet Protocol addresses are numbers that computers use to identify each other on the Internet. For example, the IP address for ermiry.com is 138.197.222.181. An ICANN department known as the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority is responsible for distributing IP addresses to ensure that two different organizations don't use the same address.

## Network Components
### Host Roles
All computers that are connected to a network and participate directly in network communications are classified as hosts. Hosts can be called end devices. Some hosts are also called clients. However, the term hosts specifically refers to devices on the network that are assigned a number for communication purposes. This number identifies the host within a particular network. This number is called the Internet Protocol (IP) address. An IP address identifies the host and the network to which the host is attached. Here we can find relations between client & servers.

### Peer-to-peer
Client and server software usually run on separate computers, but is also possible for one computer to be used for both roles at the same time. This type of network is called peer-to-peer network. Some advantages of this of configuration might be: easy to setup, lower cost because network devices and dedicated servers may not be required, can be used for simple tasks such as sharing printers and / or files. But it might also have some disadvantages: no centralized administration, not as secure, not scalable, all devices may act as botch client and servers, which can cripple performance.

### End Devices
An end devices is either the source or destination of a message transmitted over a network. Each end device on a network has its unique address (IP).

### Intermediary Devices
Intermediary devices connect the individual end devices to the network. They can connect multiple individual networks to form an inter-network. These intermediary devices provide connectivity and ensure that data flows across the network. Intermediary devices use the destination end device address, in conjunction with information about the network interconnections, to determine the path that messages should take through the network. Some examples might include: switches, routers, hubs.

### Network Media
Communication transmits across a network media. The media provides the channel over which the the message travels from the source to the destination.

## Common Types of Networks
### LANs and WANs
The two most common network infrastructures are Local Area Networks and Wide Area Networks. A LAN is a network infrastructure that provides access to users and end devices in a small geographical area. It is typically used in a home or a small office. A WAN is a network infrastructure that provides access to other networks over a wide geographical area, which is typically owned and managed by a larger corporation or a telecommunications service provider.

### The Internet
The internet is a worldwide collection of interconnected networks.

### Intranets and Extra-nets
Intranet is a term often used to refer to a private connection of LANs and WANs that belongs to an organization. An intranet is designed to be accessible only by the organization's members, employees, or others with authorization. An organization may use an extra-net to provide secure and safe access to individuals who work for a different organization but require access to the organization’s data.

## The OSI Model
OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection. It has been developed by ISO (International Organization for Standardization) in 1984. It is a seven layer architecture with each layer having specific functionality to perform. All the layers collaborate to perform to transmit the data from one computer across the globe.

The purpose of the OSI reference model is to guide vendors and developers so the digital communication products and software programs they create will interpolate, and to facilitate interactions between network tools.
