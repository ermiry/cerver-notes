# Micro Services Architecture

The main goal of software architects and engineers is to maintain a balance of speed and safety in their software systems. The micro-service architecture can be used to achieve faster delivery  and greater safety as the scale of the applications increase.

Micro-services can be defined with three characteristics:
- It is an ideal solution for scaling from small to huge system
- The architecture is goal-oriented
- It is focused on replace-ability of components, rather than maintaining existing ones

Micro-services are small, autonomous services that work together.
Loosely coupled service-oriented architecture with bounded contexts.

A micro-service is an independently deployable component of bounded scope that supports interoperability through message-based communication. Micro-service Architecture is a style of engineering highly automated, evolvable software systems made up of capability-aligned micro-services.

In a micro-service architecture, the services tend to get simpler, but the architecture needed to manage all of them gets more complex. But this can be tackled with tooling, automation, and process.
