# Security

## Cybersecurity
**From IBM**
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks. Cybersecurity measures are designed to combat threats against networked systems and applications, whether those threats originate from inside or outside of an organization.

A strong cybersecurity strategy has layers of protection to defend against cyber crime, including cyberÂ attacks that attempt to access, change, or destroy data; extort money from users or the organization; or aim to disrupt normal business operations.

## Common Cyber Threats
**From IBM**
- **Malware:** Refers to malicious software variants (worms, viruses, Trojans, and spyware) that provide unauthorized access or cause damage to a computer.
- **Ransomware:** Is a type of malware that locks down files, data or systems, and threatens to erase or destroy the data, or make private or sensitive data to the public, unless a ransom is paid to the cyber-criminals who launched the attack.
- **Phishing:** Is a form of social engineering that tricks users into providing their own PII or sensitive information.
- **Insider Threats:** Current or former employees, business partners, contractors, or anyone who has had access to systems or networks in the past can be considered an insider threat if they abuse their access permissions.
- **Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks:** A DDoS attack attempts to crash a server, website or network by overloading it with traffic, usually from multiple coordinated systems. DDoS attacks overwhelm enterprise networks via the simple network management protocol (SNMP), used for modems, printers, switches, routers, and servers.
- **Man-in-the-middle:** Is an eavesdropping attack, where a cyber-criminal intercepts and relays messages between two parties in order to steal data.

## Authentication
**From TechTarget**
Authentication is the process of determining whether someone or something is, in fact, who or what it says it is. Authentication technology provides access control for systems by checking to see if a user's credentials match the credentials in a database of authorized users or in a data authentication server. In doing this, authentication assures secure systems, secure processes and enterprise information security.

**Erick Salas**
Authentication is a process that can ensure and confirm a user's identity. Before the shared resources can be accessed, the user must provide his credentials that will be matched against the system database to provide access control.

## Encryption
**From Kaspersky**
Encryption is the conversion of data from a readable format into an encoded format. Encrypted data can only be read or processed after it's been decrypted. Encryption is the basic building block of data security. It is the simplest and most important way to ensure a computer system's information can't be stolen and read by someone who wants to use it for malicious purposes.

Data encryption software, also known as an encryption algorithm or cipher, is used to develop an encryption scheme that theoretically can only be broken with large amounts of computing power.

When information or data is shared over the internet, it goes through a series of network devices worldwide, which form part of the public internet. As data travels through the public internet, there is a chance it could be compromised or stolen by hackers. To prevent this, users can install specific software or hardware to ensure the secure transfer of data or information. These processes are known as encryption in network security.

Encryption involves using a cryptographic key, a set of mathematical values both the sender and recipient agree on. The recipient uses the key to decrypt the data, turning it back into readable plain text.

- **Symmetric encryption keys:** The key used to encode is the same as the one used to decode, making it best for individual users and closed systems. Otherwise, the key must be sent to the receiver. This increases the risk of compromise if it's intercepted by a third party.
- **Asymmetric encryption keys:** This type uses two different keys (public and private) that are linked together mathematically. The private key is kept secret by the owner, and the public key is either shared among authorized recipients or made available to the public at large.
