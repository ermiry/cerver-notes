# Packets

A packet is the basic unit of information transmitted over the Internet. Splitting information up into small, digestible pieces allows the network's capacity to be user more efficiently. A packet has two parts. The header contains information that helps the packet get to its destination, including the length of the packet, its source and destination, and sometimes a checksum value that helps the recipient detect if the packet has been damaged or tampered with along the way.
