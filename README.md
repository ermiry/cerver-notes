# Cerver Notes

Cerver is a development framework designed to provide the developers with all the necessary tools for creating fast reliable multi-purpose servers written in C/C++. It is highly customizable and with an extensive set of features out of the box, and yet, it is extremely lightweight. Cerver was designed from the ground up for fast and easy deployments, with great scalability in mind, without compromising security or reliability. Cerver has a custom packets protocol that has been created to enable the developers to just focus on their application as all the communicationâ€™s heavy lifting is handled by the framework; however they can still customize many attributes so that it is best suited to their needs. Cerver has built-in collections, threads control methods, file operations, authentication with sessions management, packets load balancer that are required to build well grounded modern applications.
