# Software

**From Mastering Algorithms in C**
A good understanding of data structures and algorithms is an important part of developing well-crafted software. Equally important is a dedication to applying sound practices in software engineering in our implementations.

**Modularity:** One way to achieve this in software design is to focus on the development of black boxes. A **black box** is a module whose internals are not intended to be seen by users of the module. Users can interact with the module only through a prescribed interface made public by its creator. Users may not be concerned with the details of how the module is implemented and are prevented from working with the module's internals.
**Readability:** Writing meaningful comments, using aptly named identifiers, and creating code that is self documenting are some ways that can make programs more readable.
**Simplicity:** More often than not intelligent approaches are the simplest ones instead of complex solutions. The simplest solutions are often the hardest to find.
**Consistency:** One of the best practices in software development is the establishment of coding conventions and stick to them in the entire code base.

## Version Control
**From Atlassian**
Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter.

Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.
