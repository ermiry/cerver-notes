# Objective

## Ideas
- A custom framework gives the developer the freedom to create core features implementations with the required approach (speed, reliability, security), and can enable to add directly extra components that are not available by default in similar software.
- Develop a dedicated framework that can be very flexible when working with distributed applications with a large set of features and the ability to add extra components for custom workflows.
- Developing a framework using the C programming language on top of Linux gives a huge freedom to interact with the OS components (network, file-system, memory) that almost no other programming language can offer.
- Once the framework has reached a stable release, it can be easily integrated with other languages and still keep its advantages but with less complexity when writing code.
